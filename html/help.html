            All adventures in a <b>square</b> of <i>block size</i> as entered in the settings are loaded.
        </li>
        <li>
            When moving over a significant distance, new adventures are loaded.
        </li>
        <li>
            Moving and zooming the map also does load other adventures.
        </li>
        <li>
            A maximum number of labs, depending on the donation status, can be loaded.
            When this number of labs in <i>block size</i> is too big the alembic shakes.
            The globe shakes when the number of labs to be displayed on the map exceeds the limit.
        <li>
            Clicking on the cross-hairs wil center the map on the current position.

            The circles on the map show the size of the geofence.
        </li>
        <li>
            This distance shown is the distance to the geofence.
        </li>
        <li>
            The input bar is active when inside the geofence.
            It's becomes inactive on leaving the geofence.
            Unless the lab is "red".
            Meaning wrong answers can be corrected outside the geofence.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adventures can be logged when there is an answer in the input bar.
        </li>

           <i>Update interval</i> is the time between two updates of the position.
           When set to 0 the position is updated
           when your device detects a change in location.
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Notif. dist.</i> is the distance from the geofence
            at which a notification will be triggered.
            When set to 0, no notifications will be given.
        </li>
        <li>
            Due to limitations of progressive web apps,
            notifications will only be shown when the app is open.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clicking on the notification will open the corresponding lab.
        </li>
