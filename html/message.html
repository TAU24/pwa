<h2>Update labs</h2>
<div class="p">
    It's now possible to add new labs to the database.
</div>
<div class="p">
    Since we don't know about a way to get the most recent labs<sup>*</sup>,
    labs are updated around random places around the globe.
    Usually it will take a few days for the labs to appear.
</div>
<div class="p">
    In some cases, for example event lab caches, that might be too long.
    As of this release it's possible to update the nearest adventures
    with the "Update Labs" button on the settings page.
</div>
<div class="p">
    Because updating labs cost a lot of recourses (and time),
    updates are restricted to one (1) in 24 hours.
